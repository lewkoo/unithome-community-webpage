## **General Information about Heating**

Building A07 is connected to the city heating system, with Kyivteploenergo as the service provider for thermal energy supply.

Since September 2024, building A07 has been switched to direct contracts with Kyivteploenergo.

Residents receive bills for consumed heat from Kyivteploenergo. The management company does not participate in financial settlements for heating.

Passports for heating meters along with initial receipts can be collected by property owners from the administrator in the lobby of section 701 from 08:00 to 20:00 daily with a signature.

In case of purchasing an apartment, do not forget to obtain these documents from the previous owner of the apartment.

The meter passport looks like this:

## **Meter Reading Submission**

The heat meter measures, calculates, and records the consumption of thermal energy (in GCal).

The meters are equipped with an automatic reading transmission system.

As of mid-December 2024, Kyivteploenergo has not yet set up remote data collection from the meters. This will be configured in the future.

## Heating Tariff

In December 2024, the cost of 1 GCal is 1654 UAH 41 kop.

In addition, the payment includes a Fee for Subscriber Service TE (Contributions for VCO maintenance).
Contributions for the maintenance of commercial accounting units are regular payments determined separately for each building, taking into account the costs of external operators.

In November 2024, the contribution amount was 39 UAH 89 kop.

Subscriber service is a payment calculated according to the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and is charged as part of the thermal energy supply services. It is charged throughout the year for all buildings receiving the aforementioned services, to one personal account, regardless of the living space area and the number of registered persons.

## **Heating of Common Areas**

Charges for heating common areas (hereinafter referred to as CA) are made by Kyivteploenergo. Parameters for calculation, such as data on the heated area of CA and each apartment, are provided by the management company to Kyivteploenergo.

Heating of CA is distributed proportionally to the area of the apartments.

In calculations, Kyivteploenergo should rely on Order No. 315 dated 22.11.2018, "On Approval of the Methodology for Distribution among Consumers of the Volumes of Consumed Utilities in the Building":

Section IV, paragraph 12: The volume of thermal energy used for the general needs of heating the building/house is distributed among all owners (co-owners) of the premises of the building/house (including premises with individual heating and separate premises with transit heating networks) proportionally to the total/heated areas/volumes of their residential/non-residential premises.

## **Meter Verification**

The verification of the heat meter is the responsibility of the property owners. The verification period is 4 years. The verification is counted from the date of sale indicated in the meter passport.

Most meters were purchased by the developer in 2020-2021 during the construction phase according to the installation plan. Therefore, in 2025, most co-owners will need to verify their heat meters.

The cost of verification in September 2024 was 2100 UAH. This cost included: verification cost + battery replacement + 20% VAT.

The battery is designed for up to 6 years. If it is not replaced during verification, the meter may turn off 1-2 years after verification, requiring another verification with battery replacement.
